This document will show you how to build a https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web[gRPC Web] service with Vert.x.

== What you will build

You will build a Vert.x gRPC server service that shows:

* the session id and when the session was created
* when the page was generated

The application fits in a single `ServerVerticle` class.

== What you need

* A text editor or an IDE
* Java 17 or higher
* Maven or Gradle
* An Infinispan cluster (or Docker)

== Create a project

The code of this project contains Maven and Gradle build files that are functionally equivalent.

=== Using Maven

Here is the content of the `pom.xml` file you should be using:

ifdef::env-github[]
link:pom.xml[Maven POM file]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[source,xml,role="collapsed"]
.Maven `pom.xml`
----
include::pom.xml[]
----
endif::env-github[]

=== Using Gradle

Assuming you use Gradle with the Kotlin DSL, here is what your `build.gradle.kts` file should look like:

ifdef::env-github[]
link:build.gradle.kts[Gradle build file]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[source,kotlin,role="collapsed"]
.Gradle `build.gradle.kts`
----
include::build.gradle.kts[]
----
endif::env-github[]

== Storing and retrieving session data with Infinispan

The Vert.x Web `SessionStore` interface provides methods to read and modify session data.

The `InfinispanSessionStore` implementation can be found in the `io.vertx:vertx-web-sstore-infinispan` artifact.

Here is the code of the `ServerVerticle` class:

ifdef::env-github[]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/howtos/web/sessions/ServerVerticle.java[ServerVerticle.java]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/howtos/web/sessions/ServerVerticle.java[]
----

<1> Create an `InfinispanSessionStore` using configuration for your Infinispan Cluster (e.g. host, port and credentials).
<2> Register the `SessionHandler`, which manages Vert.x Web Sessions.
<3> Put the session creation timestamp in the session data.
<4> Create the response body and send it to the client.
endif::env-github[]

== Running the application

If you're not familiar with Infinispan, check out the https://infinispan.org/introduction/[introduction].

To run an Infinispan server on your machine with Docker, open your terminal and execute this:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 17222:17222 -e USER="admin" -e PASS="bar" infinispan/server:14.0
----

NOTE: If you already have an Infinispan cluster running, don't forget to update the configuration (host, port and credentials) in `ServerVerticle`.

The `ServerVerticle` already has a `main` method, so it can be used as-is to:

. create a `Vertx` context, then
. deploy `ServerVerticle`.

You can run the application from:

. your IDE, by running the `main` method from the `ServerVerticle` class, or
. with Maven: `mvn compile exec:java`, or
. with Gradle: `./gradlew run` (Linux, macOS) or `gradle run` (Windows).

== Testing the application

. Browse to http://localhost:8080.
If you request this page for the first time, the session creation time should be the same as the page generation time.
. Now, let's simulate failover to another web server by stopping the application and starting it again.
. After the new web server has started, browse to http://localhost:8080 again.
The session id and session creation time shouldn't have changed (because session data has been persisted in Infinispan).

== Summary

This document covered:

. creating an `InfinispanSessionStore` instance,
. registering the Vert.x Web `SessionHandler`,
. modifying session data.
